    ==========================
    
    This version of Django requires Python 3.4, but you're trying to
    install it on Python 2.7.
    
    This may be because you are using a version of pip that doesn't
    understand the python_requires classifier. Make sure you
    have pip >= 9.0 and setuptools >= 24.2, then try again:
    
        $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
        $ python -m pip install django
    
    This will install the latest version of Django which works on your
    version of Python. If you can't upgrade your pip (or Python), request
    an older version of Django:
    
        $ python -m pip install "django<2"
